This repository contains the source code for a real-time coin detection and value calculation web application. It leverages a custom-trained Roboflow computer vision model to identify U.S. coins from a live camera feed and displays a running total of their value, all within a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

## Installation and Usage
To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    This isolates the project's dependencies from your system's Python installation.
    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure API Secrets**
    Create a `.streamlit` directory and a `secrets.toml` file within it.
    ```
    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ .streamlit/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ secrets.toml
    â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
    â””â”€â”€ ...
    ```
    Add your Roboflow credentials to `secrets.toml`:
    ```toml
    ROBOFLOW_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ROBOFLOW_PROJECT = "coin_recognition-0vii0"
    ROBOFLOW_VERSION = 1
    ```

5.  **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit.

## Deployment
This application is configured for deployment on Streamlit Community Cloud. After pushing your code to a GitHub repository (ensuring `.streamlit/` is in your `.gitignore`), you can deploy by:
1.  Connecting your GitHub account to Streamlit Cloud.
2.  Selecting the repository and branch.
3.  Adding your project secrets to the Streamlit Cloud dashboard under the app's advanced settings.
